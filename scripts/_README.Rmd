## README_Scripts

The present folder contains all the scripts used during this project's development. The script's names are very straight-forward and have the following goals:

1.  Setting Github.

2.  Getting the data from OSF.

3.  Analyzing the data to produce the project's outputs (found in the outputs folder).
