	abstract = {With the advent of molecular phylogenies the assessment of community assembly processes has become a central topic in community ecology. These processes have focused almost exclusively on habitat filtering and competitive exclusion. Recent evidence, however, indicates that facilitation has been important in preserving biodiversity over evolutionary time, with recent lineages conserving the regeneration niches of older, distant lineages. Here we test whether, if facilitation among distant-related species has preserved the regeneration niche of plant lineages, this has increased the phylogenetic diversity of communities. By analyzing a large worldwide database of species, we showed that the regeneration niches were strongly conserved across evolutionary history. Likewise, a phylogenetic supertree of all species of three communities driven by facilitation showed that nurse species facilitated distantly related species and increased phylogenetic diversity.},

	abstract = {Questions: Are positive understorey-dominant associations important in physically severe dune communities and does the strength of positive associations vary with disturbance at the local scale and with stress at the regional scale? Do associational patterns observed at the neighbourhood scale predict diversity at higher scales? Location: Coastal sand dunes, Aquitaine (France). Methods: Associational patterns with five dominant species were recorded along a local gradient of disturbance and a 240-km long regional gradient. Density, richness, cover and variance ratio of understorey species were recorded in quadrats located in dominant and in open areas. Spatial pattern of dominant plant species was recorded using a distance-based method. Results: Positive understorey-dominant associations were most frequent at both regional and local scale, although negative associations with understorey species were observed for one of the five dominants. At the regional scale, there was a shift in the magnitude of spatial associations, with higher positive associations in the most stressful sites, whereas spatial associations where not affected by the local disturbance gradient. Positive associations were not related to the size of the dominants but rather influenced by the identity of the dominant species. Conclusions: Our study highlights the potential crucial role of facilitation together with the importance of turnover of the dominants in explaining large-scale variation in diversity. However, because positive associations may also be attributed to environmental heterogeneity or co-occurrence of microhabitat preferences of species, experiments are needed to fully assess the relative importance of facilitation versus other drivers of community diversity.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10531-008-9454-9},
	abstract = {The following paper describes patterns of diversity across major habitat types in a relatively well preserved coastal dune
system in central Italy. The research addresses the following questions: (a) whether different habitats defined on the base
of a land cover map support similar levels of biodiversity in terms of vascular flora richness and number of rare and endangered
species, and (b) how each habitat contributes to the total species diversity of the coastal environment. A random stratified
sampling approach based on a detailed land cover map was applied to construct rarefaction curves for each habitat type and
to estimate total species richness. In addition, the number of exclusive, rare and endangered species was calculated for each
habitat type. Results highlight the importance of the coastal dune zonation (embryo-dune, main dune, transition and stabilized
dune) in species conservation because they harbour progressively higher species richness. However, differences among these
habitats were not significant, so no particular species rich “hotspots” could be evidenced. On the contrary, rarefaction curves
show that the upper beach (strand) habitat sustains significantly smaller number of species, but surprisingly, it shows the
highest rarity values and highest proportion of endangered species. Therefore, for the establishment of successful biodiversity
conservation programs in these coastal environments, it is imperative not only to conserve biologically rich hotspots but
also to include species poor habitats containing endangered or unique elements. Thus, the complete coastal vegetation mosaic
including all coastal habitats is important to adequately characterize the plant species diversity of coastal dune ecosystems.},
